# Configuration

This document provides guidelines for creating a configuration file for the TextQuill. The configuration file is in TOML format and is used to specify various settings required for the Tesseract, the OCR engine.

## Configuration structure

The configuration has all of its variables (as of now) in the `textquill` section. Here are all possible variables and their possible value(s):

|Variable|Possible value(s)|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`language`|any language in ISO 639-3|The language Tesseract will use to detect text.|

Here's an example configuration file:

```toml
[textquill]
language = "eng"
```
